### Welcome, to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fabian, a German freelancer and data enthusiast. After my bachelor's degree in mathematics, I joined the software industry and have been there for over 5 years now. My focus is mainly on backend development, both on-prem and in the cloud. I've also worked with GUI applications, and recently I've taken a liking to data engineering.
